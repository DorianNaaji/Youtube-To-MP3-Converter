# YoutubeToMP3Converter

![alt text](https://github.com/DorianNaaji/YoutubeToMP3Converter/blob/master/ui.png "User interface")

I'm really fond of music and I'm converting a lot of Youtube videos to Mp3 format.
I wanted to develop my own converter, just to take a look at how it works. So I made this, with quite a simple UI.

You may try it by installing it (see install.rar / install.zip, which contain the installation files. Don't forget do decompress those archives before executing "YoutubeToMP3.application")
