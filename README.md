I'm really fond of music and I'm converting a lot of Youtube videos to Mp3 format.
So I wanted to develop my own converter, just to take a look at how it works, with quite a simple UI.

You may try it by installing it (see install.rar / install.zip, which contain the installation files. Don't forget do decompress those archives before executing "YoutubeToMP3.application")

# Install

* Download install.zip
* Uncompress
* Start "setup.exe"
