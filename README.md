# Youtube To MP3 Converter [DISCONTINUED]

**⚠️ STATUS: ARCHIVED / NO LONGER MAINTAINED**

## 🛑 Why is this project discontinued?

After maintaining this tool for some time, I have decided to stop its development.

Since January 2026, YouTube has aggressively reinforced its anti-bot protections and download restrictions. The "cat-and-mouse" game required to keep this converter working has become too time-consuming.

The technical challenges now include:
* **Constant Breaking Changes:** YouTube updates its signature encryption and API almost daily.
* **Complex Requirements:** Bypassing current protections requires external JavaScript engines (Node.js), specific browser cookie injections, and solving "n-challenges" that constantly fail.
* **Maintenance Cost:** Keeping the underlying libraries (`yt-dlp`) and the code compatible with YouTube's new "Proof of Humanity" checks requires daily monitoring that I can no longer provide.

## ✅ The Best Alternative

Since batch downloading via external software is becoming increasingly difficult, I have switched to a browser-based workflow. This method is much more stable as it uses your active browser session.

I personally recommend using the following combination:

### 1. YouTube Downloader (Chromium Extension)
I use the **Addoncrop** extension. It integrates a download button directly below the YouTube video player.

👉 **Download here:** [YouTube Downloader (v27)](https://addoncrop.com/v27/youtube-downloader/)

### 2. FlixMate (Helper App)
To handle high-quality MP3 conversions and video merging, the extension works best with **FlixMate**.

## 💡 Recommended Workflow

Instead of saving links to a text file and trying to batch convert them later (which often triggers YouTube's "Bot" detection due to mass requests), I recommend changing your habit:

**Download the music/video immediately as you discover it.**

Using the extension mentioned above, it takes just one click while you are listening to the track. It is faster, more reliable, and future-proof.
